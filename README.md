Django tutorial that is presented on the django website with added homescreen 


install django by using 

pip install Django==1.8.4

Note: The command worked on Ubuntu 15.04. However on osx i think i used
pip3 instead try it if you get errors on OSX. 

to run application navigate to mysite:

python manage.py runserver

Note: On OSX i had to use python3 to run the command or else it would give me errors
